## What This Site Is

A methodology library for six distinct leveraged ETF strategies. Each strategy gets its own dedicated page with a consistent structure: overview, rules and logic, performance notes, risks and caveats, and resources. The site is educational. It documents strategy frameworks, not live trades or recommendations.

## Pages

- `/strategies` holds the source-of-truth markdown for each strategy. These are reference documents, not live-rendered content. Each file includes a `<!-- RESEARCH SOURCES -->` comment block with all research URLs used; this block is never ported to HTML.
- `/docs` holds the product requirements (`prd.md`), design system (`design.md`), and changelog (`patchnotes.md`).

## Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript only
- No external dependencies, no build step, no package manager
- System font stack, no external font loading
- Designed for GitHub Pages static hosting

## Running Locally

No build step required. Either open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder locally:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deploying

The site is live at **https://azqato.github.io/leverage/**

To deploy updates: push to the `main` branch. GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the repo root. The site is fully static and requires no additional configuration.

## Design

The site follows the Azqato brand system: GitHub Dark-inspired palette, teal accent (`#00d4a0`), wiki-style sidebar layout, and system fonts. See `docs/design.md` for the full design specification.

## Disclaimer

Educational use only. Nothing on this site is financial advice. Leveraged ETFs carry significant risk including volatility decay and amplified drawdowns.
